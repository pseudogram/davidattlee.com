These requests may be one of a variety of different protocols UDP, TCP and HTTP (being the most common). Not to mention they can also act the first line of defence, securing connections, monitoring traffic and more. What’s more, once a request has been handled it responds by <em>serving</em> the appropriate content.</p><h1 id="break-it-down-to-basics">Break it down to Basics</h1><p>Web Server, may refer to hardware, software, or the conjunction of the two. The hardware stores the web server software, a websites component files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, etc). And is connected to the internet. The software controls how web users access hosted files. By using <em>at least</em> an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLs, and HTTP.<br>A web server can be accessed through domain names (like davidattlee.com). So, when a browser requests a file (hosted on a server), the browser requests a file via HTTP, using the domain name. The request reaches the correct web server (the hardware) and the HTTP server (software) accepts the request. After which it finds the requested file, and sends it back to the browser (via HTTP once again). If the file is unfound then a 404 response is returned.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2020/03/image-1.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption><a href="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2014/09/24/8659/e4dbea826891566db3802b34fd0d836f/web-server.svg">Mozilla, What is a web servber</a></figcaption></figure><p>Now theres two types of web servers, static and dynamic. We call one a static web server, or stack, when it sends files “as-is” to your browser (think craigslist). Alternatively, a dynamic web server uses extra software (eg. an application server and a database). We say “dynamic” because the server updates the hosted files before sending them. Most modern websites are like this as it makes it easier to set up, modify and maintain.</p><h1 id="give-me-an-analogy-i-don-t-get-it-">Give me an analogy. I don't get it.</h1><p>Think of a web server like a hosts at a fancy restaurant. You arrive, they greet you, check your booking and guide you to your table. Once seated they bring you a menu, after which they handle all communications with the kitchen and bringing you each course. As you ask for it, When you ask for it. Occasionally, you may request something for the menu and the kitchen has run out (and that's your 404).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2020/03/image-2.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/warnerarchive-short-hot-dog-dogville-l41lQKzFg8T8p7oas">Hotdog Waiter GIF</a></figcaption></figure><h1 id="ok-so-how-do-i-make-one">Ok, so how do I make one?</h1><p>Dear god, don't make one yourself. There are plenty of great, <em>free</em> open source solutions out there. Take your pick. NGINX is currently the most popular, and incredibly easy to set up. However, if you're setting up a personal website and you hate yourself, try IIS.</p><ol><li>NGINX</li><li>APACHE</li><li>IIS</li></ol><p>My Reading:</p><ul><li>Mozilla have a great  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server#Summary">article</a> , that I pretty much lifted.</li><li><a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Web-server">What is a web server</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/apache/">What is Apache</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">A wiki about web servers</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">A wiki about Communication protocols</a></li><li><a href="http://ecomputernotes.com/computernetworkingnotes/computer-network/protocol">What is a protocol</a><br>Further Reading:</li><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server#Hosting_files">Hosting files</a></li><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server#Communicating_through_HTTP">Communicating through HTTP</a></li><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server#Static_vs._dynamic_content">Static vs. Dynamic</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/web-servers/nginx/nginx-installation-and-basic-setup/">Set up an NGINX server</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What's the difference between Managed or Unmanaged Resource?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>When programming there is the concept managed and unmanaged resources.
