Unfortunately, I didn't back up my old blog (rookie mistake, I know) before deleting it. So I'm trying to rewrite some posts based on notes I have in Google Docs/Evernote/Bear. Just bear with me until May 1st.</p><p>Before reading on, there are a few things you may need to understand a little first. None require much reading as I'll explain all the commands I use.</p><ol><li><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> blog</li><li><a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> +<a href="https://guide.freecodecamp.org/git/"> Git</a></li><li><a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a></li><li>Basic bash commands ( <code>cd</code>, <code>mkdir</code> )</li></ol><h3 id="overview">Overview</h3><ol><li>Create a GitHub Repo &amp; Turn on GitHub Pages</li><li>Install Prerequisites</li><li>Running Ghost, using Docker</li><li>Generate a static website</li></ol><h2 id="step-1-create-a-github-repo-turn-on-github-pages">Step 1: Create a GitHub Repo &amp; Turn on GitHub Pages</h2><p>GitHub pages are amazing. They allow you to host a static website in a repo for <strong>free</strong>! Considering that GitHub is also currently home to the largest source of open source code <strong>and</strong> Microsoft owns it, you can put your worries to rest with regards to its spontaneous collapse.</p><ul><li>First, create a repo. If you're using the default GitHub pages URL, then you'll need to name your repo <em>your-github-username.github.io</em> (where my username is pseudogram my repository would be called psuedogram.github.io). Otherwise, if you have a domain, you can name the repo whatever you like.</li><li>In the repo, select the Settings tab.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2020/04/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Hosting a Ghost blog on GitHub"></figure><ul><li>Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and select a source. Here I chose the <strong>master branch /docs </strong>folder for organisation purposes (until a docs folder exists, you won't be able to choose this option).</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="/content/images/2020/04/Screenshot-2020-03-26-at-11.26.26.png" class="kg-image" alt="Hosting a Ghost blog on GitHub"></figure><ul><li>Below you'll see an option to add your custom domain [<a href="https://benwiz.io/blog/deploy-github-pages-with-aws-route-53-and-https/">see for AWS</a>] and an option to enforce HTTPS.</li><li>Then clone this repo onto your local machine.</li></ul><h2 id="step-1-install-prerequisites">Step 1: Install Prerequisites</h2><p>There was a python project called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/buster/">Buster</a> that allowed you to generate a static version of a website, but as it was left unsupported someone built a similar tool in node - aptly named the <a href="https://github.com/pseudogram/ghost-static-site-generator">Ghost Static Site Generator</a> (GSSG). I've forked the repo in the off chance that I feel like fixing a bug, or it gets removed [though I doubt it].</p><p>Requirements:</p><ul><li>Node v8 LTS</li><li>wget v1.16</li></ul><p>If you don't have the requirements, and you're a Mac user install <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> because it's a godsend.</p><pre><code class="language-bash"># Install Node
brew install node

# Install wget
brew install wget

# Install the static site generator using npm
npm install -g ghost-static-site-generator</code></pre><h2 id="step-3-running-ghost-using-docker">Step 3: Running Ghost, using Docker</h2><p>Using Docker simplifies the process of setting up Ghost to near nothing. Decide on a folder to which you want to save all your websites state information (I chose the same repo as my website - hence why I chose to point towards the docs file earlier, in GitHub).</p><p>In your local terminal, navigate to your cloned website repo, and create a folder called data.</p><pre><code>cd \path\to\repo

mkdir data</code></pre><p>This next command pulls a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost">ghost image</a> from Docker Hub and starts a container [at the time of writing 3.13.3-alpine is the latest image tag]. It's better to declare the version rather than using the tag <strong>latest</strong>, as it may produce version conflicts with your saved content. Below I'll also explain each part of the command.</p><pre><code class="language-bash"># run container
docker run -d --name ghost -e url= -p 3001:2368 -v /path/to/repo/data:/var/lib/ghost/content ghost:3.13.3-alpine


run  # starts a Docker container, and if the image doesn't exist locally it attempts to pull it from Docker Hub

-d  # runs the container in a detached state (in the background)

--name  # assigns the container a name for easy access (rather than an ID)

-e  # sets environment variables
url =  # Used by Ghost to display previews

-v /path/to/repo/data:/var/lib/ghost/content # Mounts the content from data into the  data from local path given into ghost content file, saving state

ghost: 3.13.3-alpine # creates an image of Ghost using specific image label</code></pre><p>Once you've started the container, you should be able to access your ghost blog at <em>localhost:3001.</em> Then, following the <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/">standard instructions</a>, navigate to the admin console by adding <em>/ghost </em>to the URL. Once you're ready, generate a new version of your static website [go to step 4].</p><p>You may want to shut down your unused docker containers — when I leave docker running on and Mac, it turns into a little portable radiator.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">docker container rm --force ghost  # shut down the container, using the label given</code></pre><p>Finally, the next time you start your container there should be no need to enter the long command from earlier — instead, you can start the container using the label you gave the first time (in my case <em>ghost</em>).</p><pre><code class="language-bash">docker start ghost</code></pre><h2 id="step-4-generate-a-static-website">Step 4: Generate a Static Website</h2><p>Once you're ready to save the state of your website — assuming, you're still in website repo, and you've published all of the posts you wish to show the world — you can generate the website using the tool GSSG installed earlier. I've tried a variation of the arguments and below is the best combo I found.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">gssg --domain  --url  --ignore-absolute-paths --dest docs


gssg  # run the ghost static site generator
--domain   # scrape the website from this URL

--url   # replace any references to your local address with this URL (GitHub pages or personal domain)

--ignore-absolute-paths  # swaps all domain names for relative paths, nullifying SEO

--dest docs  # save the static version of the website in the docs folder</code></pre><blockquote>I found without adding `ignore-absolute-paths` that there were errors in generating the static site. One day I'll look into this bug but, for now, I'm happy.</blockquote><p>Last but not least, push your repo to GitHub. If all has gone well, you should see your website live within a couple of minutes.</p><p>I'm not adding comments or analytics to this blog, but you can always <a href="https://twitter.com/justaboutdavid">@me</a>.

These requests may be one of a variety of different protocols UDP, TCP and HTTP (being the most common). Not to mention they can also act the first line of defence, securing connections, monitoring traffic and more. What’s more, once a request has been handled it responds by <em>serving</em> the appropriate content.</p><h1 id="break-it-down-to-basics">Break it down to Basics</h1><p>Web Server, may refer to hardware, software, or the conjunction of the two. The hardware stores the web server software, a websites component files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, etc). And is connected to the internet. The software controls how web users access hosted files. By using <em>at least</em> an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLs, and HTTP.<br>A web server can be accessed through domain names (like davidattlee.com). So, when a browser requests a file (hosted on a server), the browser requests a file via HTTP, using the domain name. The request reaches the correct web server (the hardware) and the HTTP server (software) accepts the request. After which it finds the requested file, and sends it back to the browser (via HTTP once again). If the file is unfound then a 404 response is returned.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2020/03/image-1.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption><a href="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2014/09/24/8659/e4dbea826891566db3802b34fd0d836f/web-server.svg">Mozilla, What is a web servber</a></figcaption></figure><p>Now theres two types of web servers, static and dynamic. We call one a static web server, or stack, when it sends files “as-is” to your browser (think craigslist). Alternatively, a dynamic web server uses extra software (eg. an application server and a database). We say “dynamic” because the server updates the hosted files before sending them. Most modern websites are like this as it makes it easier to set up, modify and maintain.</p><h1 id="give-me-an-analogy-i-don-t-get-it-">Give me an analogy. I don't get it.</h1><p>Think of a web server like a hosts at a fancy restaurant. You arrive, they greet you, check your booking and guide you to your table. Once seated they bring you a menu, after which they handle all communications with the kitchen and bringing you each course. As you ask for it, When you ask for it. Occasionally, you may request something for the menu and the kitchen has run out (and that's your 404).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/content/images/2020/03/image-2.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/warnerarchive-short-hot-dog-dogville-l41lQKzFg8T8p7oas">Hotdog Waiter GIF</a></figcaption></figure><h1 id="ok-so-how-do-i-make-one">Ok, so how do I make one?</h1><p>Dear god, don't make one yourself.
